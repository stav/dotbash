# Projects for context switching using Python virtual environments
# Sample file: copy to ~/.bash_projects to add secret projects
# Python virtual environments are labeled as venv (dash will use pipenv)

#         key      venv     directory
projekts['abc']='  py36     Work/MyProject1 '
projekts['123']='  my-env   Work/MyProject2 '
projekts['xyz']='  -        Work/MyProject3 '

#   $ sw abc
