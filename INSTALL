INSTALL

The provided `install.sh` script will create symlinks in $HOME to point to the
dotfiles from the repo.

If any of these files exist, then a backup is made of each, which will be again
overwritten if you run the install a second time.

Run the install::

	$ git clone git@github.com:stav/dotfiles.git

	$ cd dotfiles

	$ ./install.sh
